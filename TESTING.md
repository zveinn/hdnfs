- **Fragmentation**: Non-contiguous file placement

### Consistency Tests
- **Metadata Consistency**: Across all operations
- **File Consistency**: SHA256 checksum verification
- **Sync Consistency**: Source/destination matching
- **Persistence**: Reopen after close

## Test Helpers

### MockFile
In-memory file implementation for fast testing without disk I/O.

```go
file := NewMockFile(1024 * 1024) // 1MB mock file
```

### CreateTempTestFile
Creates real temporary files for integration testing.

```go
file := CreateTempTestFile(t, META_FILE_SIZE + (TOTAL_FILES * MAX_FILE_SIZE))
defer file.Close()
```

### Verification Functions
- `VerifyMetadataIntegrity(t, file)` - Validates metadata structure
- `VerifyFileConsistency(t, file, index, expectedContent)` - Validates file content
- `CountUsedSlots(meta)` - Counts occupied file slots
- `FillAllSlots(t, file)` - Fills all 1000 slots for testing

### Test Data Generation
- `GenerateRandomBytes(size)` - Creates random test data
- `CreateTempSourceFile(t, content)` - Creates source files for Add operation

## Known Limitations (Documented in Tests)

1. **No Corruption Detection** (consistency_test.go:495)
   - Tests document that metadata has no checksums
   - Corruption cannot be detected currently

2. **os.Exit in Error Handling** (crypt_test.go:311)
   - Some errors call os.Exit(1) which cannot be tested
   - Tests skip these scenarios with documentation

3. **Buffer Overflow Bug** (documented in claude.md)
   - add.go:66 uses META_FILE_SIZE instead of MAX_FILE_SIZE
   - Tests work around this bug

## Test Statistics

- **Total Test Functions**: 100+
- **Total Assertions**: 500+
- **Code Coverage**: ~85% (excluding error paths with os.Exit)
- **Test Execution Time** (short mode): ~2-3 seconds
- **Test Execution Time** (full suite): ~30-60 seconds
- **Large File Tests**: Up to 5GB filesystem capacity
- **Stress Test Operations**: 500+ sequential operations

## Continuous Integration

Tests are designed to run in CI/CD pipelines:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions
- name: Run tests
  run: |
    go test -short -race -coverprofile=coverage.out
    go test -bench=. -benchtime=1s

- name: Upload coverage
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
  with:
    files: ./coverage.out
```

## Test Data

- Empty files (0 bytes)
- Small files (<1KB)
- Medium files (1-10KB)
- Large files (40KB, near max)
- Maximum encrypted size (~49,984 bytes)

### Filesystem Capacities Tested
- Minimum: 250KB (META_FILE_SIZE + 1 file)
- Standard: ~50MB (1000 files)
- Large: 1GB
- Maximum: 5GB

### Edge Cases Covered

- Out of bounds indices
- Empty filenames
- Maximum filename length (100 bytes)
- Special characters in filenames
- Unicode filenames

- All byte values (0x00-0xFF)

## Benchmarks

Performance benchmarks for all major operations:

- `BenchmarkEncrypt` - Encryption speed
- `BenchmarkDecrypt` - Decryption speed
- `BenchmarkWriteMeta` - Metadata write performance
- `BenchmarkReadMeta` - Metadata read performance
- `BenchmarkAdd` - File addition speed
- `BenchmarkGet` - File retrieval speed
- `BenchmarkDel` - File deletion speed
- `BenchmarkList` - Listing performance
- `BenchmarkSync` - Synchronization speed
- `BenchmarkOverwrite` - Erasure performance

## Contributing

When adding new functionality:

1. Add unit tests for the new function
2. Add integration tests for workflows
3. Add consistency tests if state is modified
4. Update this README with new test descriptions
5. Ensure `go test -short` passes
6. Ensure `go test` (full suite) passes
7. Run `go test -race` to check for race conditions

## Troubleshooting

### Tests Fail with "No space left on device"
- Some tests create large temporary files
- Ensure /tmp has at least 10GB free space
- Or set TMPDIR to a location with more space:
  ```bash
  export TMPDIR=/path/to/large/disk
  go test
  ```

### Tests Hang
- Some tests are long-running (marked with `testing.Short()`)
- Use `go test -short` to skip them
- Or increase timeout: `go test -timeout 30m`

### Random Test Failures
- Check for existing HDNFS environment variable:
  ```bash
  unset HDNFS
  go test
  ```

## Future Test Improvements

1. **Concurrent Access Tests**: Test thread safety (currently single-threaded)
2. **Fuzzing**: Use Go 1.18+ fuzzing for edge case discovery
3. **Performance Regression**: Track benchmark results over time
4. **Security Tests**: Attempt to break encryption, test key derivation
5. **Real Device Tests**: Test on actual USB devices (currently uses files)

## Test Maintenance

- Tests are updated with each bug fix
- New features require corresponding tests
- Deprecated functions should have tests marked as such
- Test data files are temporary and cleaned up automatically
