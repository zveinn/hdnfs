## Benchmarks Included

Performance benchmarks for all major operations:
- BenchmarkEncrypt/Decrypt
- BenchmarkWriteMeta/ReadMeta
- BenchmarkAdd/Get/Del
- BenchmarkList (with/without filter)
- BenchmarkSync
- BenchmarkOverwrite (1MB, 10MB)
- BenchmarkReadBlock/WriteBlock
- BenchmarkLargeFilesystemAdd/Read

## Test Helpers & Utilities

### MockFile
In-memory file implementation for fast testing:
```go
type MockFile struct {
    data     []byte
    position int64
    closed   bool
}
```

### Verification Functions
- `VerifyMetadataIntegrity(t, file)` - Validates metadata structure
- `VerifyFileConsistency(t, file, index, content)` - Validates file content
- `CountUsedSlots(meta)` - Counts files
- `FillAllSlots(t, file)` - Fills filesystem for testing

### Data Generation
- `GenerateRandomBytes(size)` - Random test data
- `CreateTempTestFile(t, size)` - Temporary real files
- `CreateTempSourceFile(t, content)` - Source files for Add

## Known Issues Documented

Tests document but work around these issues:

1. **Buffer Overflow (add.go:66)**
   - Uses `META_FILE_SIZE` instead of `MAX_FILE_SIZE`
   - Tests account for this but document the bug

2. **No Corruption Detection**
   - Metadata has no checksums
   - Test: `TestConsistencyWithCorruptedMetadata`
   - Documents limitation

3. **os.Exit in Error Paths**
   - Some errors call `os.Exit(1)`
   - Cannot be tested (tests skip with documentation)
   - Affects: empty key, truncated data, uninitialized metadata

## Running the Tests

### Quick Test (3-5 seconds)
```bash
go test -short
```

### Full Test Suite (30-60 seconds)
```bash
go test
```

### Verbose Output
```bash
go test -short -v
```

### Specific Tests
```bash
go test -run TestEncrypt       # Encryption tests
go test -run TestMeta          # Metadata tests
go test -run TestLarge         # Large file tests
go test -run TestConsistency   # Consistency tests
```

### With Race Detection
```bash
go test -short -race
```

### Benchmarks

## Continuous Integration

Tests are CI/CD ready:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions
name: Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-go@v4
        with:
          go-version: '1.22'
      - name: Run tests

```

## Future Enhancements

Potential test improvements:
1. Concurrent access tests (thread safety)
2. Fuzzing tests (Go 1.18+)
3. Performance regression tracking
4. Security penetration tests
5. Real USB device tests (currently uses files)
6. Property-based testing
7. Mutation testing
